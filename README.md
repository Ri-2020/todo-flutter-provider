# My Todo App

My Todo App is a simple yet powerful task management application built using Flutter with the Provider state management. This app was developed as a learning project to gain hands-on experience with Provider, building upon previous knowledge of GetX and Redux state management.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this app is to explore and understand the Provider package for state management in Flutter. It was created quickly as a practical exercise to transition from other state management solutions to Provider.

## Features

My Todo App provides the following features:

- **Create**: You can easily create new tasks or to-dos to keep track of your work or personal activities.

- **Read**: View your tasks in a clean and organized interface. Tasks are categorized by priority for easy management.

- **Update**: Edit or modify existing tasks to keep your task list up to date.

- **Delete**: Remove tasks that are no longer relevant or needed.

- **Priority System**: The app includes a priority system to categorize tasks as Low, Medium, or High priority. This allows you to identify and manage tasks based on their importance.

- **Color-coded Priority**: Each task is represented with a different color-coded dot to quickly visualize its priority. Low-priority tasks have one color, medium-priority tasks another, and high-priority tasks a third.


## Technologies Used

- Flutter: The app is built using Flutter, a popular open-source UI software development kit.

- Provider: State management is achieved using the Provider package, a robust solution for Flutter apps.
